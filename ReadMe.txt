THe program is relatively simple to use. Simply start it up, and run it.

Once started it'll display two views, instructor and student. With roles to manage course/questions and take a test respectively

Once you add a new question to a course, it'll automatically up and you'll be redirected to the home page.

Once a student takes a test, it'll update the relevant course questions.
